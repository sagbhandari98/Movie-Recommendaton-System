# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end implementation of a movie recommendation system using machine learning. It encompasses data preprocessing, model building, and website deployment using Streamlit.

### Key Features

- **Dataset:** Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing movie information.
- **Preprocessing:** Performed data preprocessing tasks to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Developed machine learning models to recommend movies based on user preferences.
- **Website Development:** Created an interactive website using Streamlit to provide users with a seamless movie recommendation experience.

- ### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Streamlit app to access the movie recommendation system.

### Future Improvements

- Implement advanced recommendation algorithms.
- Enhance the website UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience.
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to improve recommendation accuracy.
